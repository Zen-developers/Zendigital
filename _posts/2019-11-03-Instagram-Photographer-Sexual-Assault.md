We report on some of it, but not all of it. We report on it if we think it reflects a bigger issue that hasn’t been completely understood by fashion or by consumers. Or if something has changed, like when the Mexican minister wrote a letter to Carolina Herrera. That’s meaningful because a national government is getting involved in one of these issues. Sometimes it can be gratuitous online or feel unfair. This is a big conversation that everyone is having and it is right to have it. The times have changed and so fashion’s approach to these issues needs to change. Things that were completely acceptable, that no one blinked at five years ago, are no longer acceptable. We have to both acknowledge that fashion has a history of appropriation and flash inspiration, and that it is deeply embedded in fashion and that has always been the case. It still needs to change. Those two things are not necessarily something we should get upset about, but that we need to acknowledge and try to grapple with.
