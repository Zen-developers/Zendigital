We talk to TSA about his recent collaboration with adidas on the “Road Not Taken” campaign – “I always been a fun of adidas since I was a kid”.

TSA is currently living in New York. “Whenever I am here, I feel like I belong than in any other place”. When growing up in London TSA always felt like an outsider. He started making music from a very young age, he enjoyed hanging with friends and watching movies. “We’re young men, and we didn’t know any better”. 
What were your first pair of shoes you bought? “That’s pretty obvious, Adidas! It is unbelievable, I never thought I would work with Adidas”. TSA is the main model for the autumn Adidas campaign focused on creating clothes with renewable fabrics. Most of us are familiar with Adidas first encounter  using renewable materials to reduce the production pollution with the Adidas Boost Foam. TSA gained recognition after producing John Mayer’s “3x5” the album was nominated twice and won a Grammy Award. Where were you when you found out you have been nominated? “I was at the studio working on my songs when John called and I was like ‘alright, alright’ a week later I was demystified then I called my mom”
