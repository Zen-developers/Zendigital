This week, 19-year-old Norwegian editor and publisher Elise By Olsen (Recens Paper, Wallet) is the guest editor of AnOthermag.com, presenting a series of articles exploring the current and future state of fashion and art publishing. Alongside conversations with publishers, critics and image-makers, this guest edit offers an intimate insight into her own publications and working practice.

I’ve been a collector of books, magazines and other publications for a long time. I vividly remember being around nine years old and dropping by the newsstand after school and purchasing some magazines with my pocket money, or else getting clavicle pain from lugging around backpacks full of them when travelling. This collection grew into my more developed personal bedroom library, which I am dedicated to building upon. I often think about Walter Benjamin’s essay Unpacking My Library: A Talk About Book Collecting and his intimate relationship with his library – and of course, I can relate. “To a book collector, you see, the true freedom of all books is somewhere on his shelves,” he writes.

As a publisher, I’m obviously immersed in fashion publishing and feel a responsibility to stay abreast of the field. Yet, when I was asked to recommend a reading list during a lecture at Central Saint Martins last year, I couldn’t think of a single publication. Instead, I remember saying how I think fashion criticism is in a poor state, unlike in other cultural spheres such as film and art, where criticism is a more embraced, or more respected, discipline. And obviously I could recommend a lot of fabulous visual fashion magazines, but publications for research... I sent the student home with a reading list totally unrelated to fashion. This got me thinking that I should really look into what I’m reading – so I went straight into my library and compiled a pile of my favourite fashion publications for research. Central Saint Martins students, this is for you.
