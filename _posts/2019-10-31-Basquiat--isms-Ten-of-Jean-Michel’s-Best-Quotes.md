As a child, photographer Cindy Sherman had an experience viewing a film which would leave an enduring impression on her, and go on to influence one of her greatest bodies of work. “I happened upon a movie told entirely through still images, except for one brief moment of motion”, she would later recall. “I didn’t remember the name of it, only the fact that I was entranced by the story told through these still images.” As an adult, she would re-encounter the film and discover it was Chris Marker’s La Jetée (1962), a story which he constructed almost exclusively through single static shots; a brief shot of a woman opening her eyes was the only moving image in the film. This interest in the ability to create narrative through single images would come to fruition in Sherman’s own work through her Untitled Film Stills (1977-1980). In this series of photographs, Sherman would create her own sequence of still images, but in contrast to Marker’s film, her shots were not intended to form a linear narrative. Instead, each image was designed to suggest the world of a different film in itself, inviting the viewer to imagine the story from which each image had been taken.  

Sherman plays all the characters in the Untitled Film Stills herself. But while the series has often been interpreted as a form of self-portraiture, she maintains the photographs are not autobiographical, and that they are entirely fictional and drawn from cinema. La Jetée would not be the only film to influence her work: the series also takes inspiration from a number of other notable films, directors, and actresses from the 1950s to the 1970s, while also challenging and reinventing the images of women seen in many of these films. In creating her series, Sherman drew from a wealth of film viewing experiences from many stages of her life, including early viewings of Hitchcock’s Rear Window, movie screenings attended while a student at Buffalo, and films she saw in New York after moving to the city in 1977.
